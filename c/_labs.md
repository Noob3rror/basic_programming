### Variables Simple
Create at least 3 variables of different types and print their values out.
- Include <stdio.h> and use the `printf()` function to print the values.
    - You will need to research what **format specifier** is required for each of your 3 types.
- Bonus: Also print the memory addresses of these variables.

### Search an Array
Create a function that uses a `for` loop to iterate an array and find a specific value. Return the index of that value.
- Disregard multiple matching values and simply return the first index with a matching value.
- You may use a 'global' array to keep things simple but if you want to practice pointers have the function take a pointer to the array to search.
- The array can hold any data type you want but I suggest a integer type for simplicity.
- Determine what the function should do when no match is found. Consider usage of this function and what is 'safe-code' practices.
